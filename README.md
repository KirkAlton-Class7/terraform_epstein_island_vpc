# Retern to Epstein Island 💠🛩️🏝️
This repo automates my infrastructure for BAM 4.1: [*Epstein Island - VIP Island Party*](https://github.com/KirkAlton-Class7/hmwk_10.04.2025_class7/blob/main/bam_4.1_class7.md)

> [!NOTE]  
> EC2 key pairs are commented out in `07-ec2.tf`. Uncomment and replace them with your own keypair before deploying in Terraform, then access the bastion host to verify RDP and SSH conectivity.

## To replicate, clone this repo, then edit and launch in Terraform (deploys in us-east-1)
```shell
git clone https://github.com/KirkAlton-Class7/terraform_epstein_island_vpc
```
